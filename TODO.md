## TODO list.

- [x] Implement the autoscroll guard feature in the context menu.
- [ ] Simplify the upload UI,
- [ ] Upload the epub file while the user drags it into the window.
- [ ] Add a switch to enable the specified context menu item.
- [ ] Add the setting icon to the home page.
- [ ] Make the input box of the prompt adjustable in size.
- [ ] Built-in prompt recommendations.
- [ ] Make the app support PWA features.
- [x] The page-turning keys should be centered at the top and bottom.
- [ ] Volume keys should be used for page turning. I think maybe we can play some MP3 (the file does not include any metadata) files and then listen to the volume change as the user taps the volume keys.

- [x] Minimize the menu bar ICONS and page-turning ICONS to give as much space as possible to display book content.
- [ ] Add a built-in context menu component, which is an aggregated translation component that supports multiple translations, and this function is required to be customizable to enable or disable.

- [ ] Issue: AI completion suggestions are not stopping when the user is component is destroyed.
