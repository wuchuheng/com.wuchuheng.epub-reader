## TODO list.

- [ ] Implement the autoscroll guard feature in the context menu.
- [ ] Simplify the upload UI,
- [ ] Upload the epub file while user drags it into the window.
- [ ] Add a switch to enable the specified context menu item.
- [ ] Add the setting icon in the home page.
- [ ] Make the input box of the prompt adjustable in size.
- [ ] Built-in prompt recommendations.
- [ ] Make the app support PWA features.
- [ ] The page-turning keys should be centered at the top and bottom.
- [ ] Volume keys should be used for page turning. I think may be we can play some mp3 (the file is not included any metadata) files and then to listen to the volume change as user taps the volume keys.
