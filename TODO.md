## TODO list.

- [ ] Implement the autoscroll guard feature in the context menu.
- [ ] Simplify the upload UI,
- [ ] Upload the epub file while user drags it into the window.
- [ ] Add a switch to enable the specified context menu item.
- [ ] Add the setting icon in the home page.
- [ ] Make the input box of the prompt adjustable in size.
- [ ] Built-in prompt recommendations.
- [ ] Make the app support PWA features.
- [x] The page-turning keys should be centered at the top and bottom.
- [ ] Volume keys should be used for page turning. I think may be we can play some mp3 (the file is not included any metadata) files and then to listen to the volume change as user taps the volume keys.

- [x] Minimize the menu bar ICONS and page-turning ICONS to give as much space as possible to display book content.
- [ ] Add a built-in context menu component, which is an aggregated translation component that supports the following multiple translations, and this function is required to be customizable to be enabled or disabled.
