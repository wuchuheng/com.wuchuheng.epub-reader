## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **Placeholder Components**: Home component is generic Vite starter template
2. **Unused Dependencies**: Some existing dependencies may not be needed for final app
3. **Router Configuration**: Routes don't match actual app structure from design
4. **No Error Boundaries**: No error handling components implemented
5. **No Loading States**: No loading indicators or progressive loading

### Performance Considerations

1. **Bundle Size**: No code splitting implemented yet
2. **Asset Optimization**: No image optimization or compression
3. **Memory Management**: No cleanup patterns for large EPUB files
4. **Caching Strategy**: No intelligent caching for book content

## Current Blockers & Dependencies

### Technical Blockers

1. **OPFS Browser Support**: Need to implement feature detection and fallbacks
2. **EPUB.js Configuration**: Complex setup required for security and performance
3. **AI API Costs**: Need to implement rate limiting and cost management
4. **Memory Management**: Large EPUB files require careful memory handling

### External Dependencies

1. **Browser APIs**: OPFS support varies across browsers
2. **API Availability**: Dictionary and AI services must be accessible
3. **Network Connectivity**: Offline/online state management needed
4. **Storage Quotas**: Browser storage limits may affect large libraries

## Evolution of Key Decisions

### Storage Strategy Evolution

1. **Initial Plan**: Simple localStorage for books
2. **Revised Plan**: OPFS with IndexedDB fallback for better performance and storage
3. **Current Decision**: OPFS-first with graceful degradation

### Architecture Evolution

1. **Initial Approach**: Monolithic component structure
2. **Refined Approach**: Feature-based organization with service layer
3. **Current Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with Redux Toolkit

### AI Integration Evolution

1. **Original Scope**: Basic dictionary lookup only
2. **Enhanced Vision**: Multi-provider AI with custom tools
3. **Current Plan**: Extensible plugin-like architecture for AI tools

## Next Sprint Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps (This Sprint)

1. **Install Core Dependencies**: EPUB.js, PWA tools, utilities
2. **Create Basic Structure**: Main page components and routing
3. **OPFS Foundation**: Basic storage service implementation
4. **Simple Book Upload**: File handling and basic validation

### Success Criteria for Next Sprint

- [ ] User can upload an EPUB file to the application
- [ ] File is stored in OPFS (or fallback storage)
- [ ] Basic bookshelf shows uploaded books
- [ ] User can open a book and see basic EPUB content
- [ ] PWA can be installed on supported browsers

### Risk Mitigation

1. **OPFS Compatibility**: Implement fallback early in sprint
2. **EPUB.js Complexity**: Start with minimal configuration, iterate
3. **Performance Issues**: Monitor memory usage from day one
4. **Browser Testing**: Test across target browsers weekly

This progress document provides a comprehensive view of current status and clear next steps for continuing development efficiently.
