# Progress: EPUB Reader Implementation Status

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### Project Foundation

- **Development Environment**: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript setup complete
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit store configured with bookshelfSlice
- **Routing**: React Router v6 configured with BookshelfPage, EpubReader, SettingsPage
- **Styling System**: TailwindCSS + CSS Modules + LESS setup working
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier configuration active

#### Core Architecture

- **Complete TypeScript interfaces** for all data models (BookMetadata, EPUBMetaData, AppSettings, OPFSConfig)
- **Redux Toolkit integration** with bookshelfSlice for state management
- **Updated routing configuration** with proper routes for main pages

#### Storage Layer (OPFS)

- **Complete OPFSManager service** with singleton pattern and feature detection
- **Full CRUD operations** for book storage (upload, read, delete, list)
- **Error handling and fallback strategies** for corrupted configs
- **File validation** (EPUB format, 100MB limit)
- **Metadata extraction** from EPUB files
- **Configuration management** with JSON-based metadata storage

#### EPUB Processing

- **EPUBMetadataService** for comprehensive metadata extraction
- **Cover image extraction** with fallback handling
- **Chapter counting** and author formatting
- **ISBN extraction** from identifiers

#### UI Components

- **BookCard component** with responsive design, progress bars, and action buttons
- **UploadZone component** with drag-and-drop support and visual feedback
- **BookshelfPage** with complete library management interface
- **EpubReader and SettingsPage** placeholder components ready for enhancement

#### State Management

- **Redux slice** with async thunks for all bookshelf operations
- **Loading states** and error handling throughout
- **Upload progress tracking**
- **Real-time updates** after operations

### üöß In Progress / Partially Complete

#### EPUB Reader Implementation

- **EpubReader component** exists as placeholder - needs EPUB.js integration
- **Reading interface** not yet implemented
- **Chapter navigation** pending EPUB.js setup

#### Advanced Features

- **Settings page** exists as placeholder - needs configuration UI
- **Table of Contents** sidebar not yet implemented
- **Text selection system** not yet started
- **Dictionary integration** pending implementation
- **AI features** not yet started

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented

#### Enhanced Reading Features

- **TOCSidebar component** for chapter navigation
- **Text selection and popup system**
- **Dictionary popup with Eudic API integration**
- **Search functionality** within books
- **Reading progress tracking** with persistence

#### AI Integration

- **AI provider configuration system**
- **Custom AI tool management**
- **AI explanation popup tabs**
- **Responsive tab management**

#### PWA Features

- **PWA configuration** with Workbox
- **Service worker** for offline functionality
- **App installation** flow
- **Update notification system**

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **EpubReader is placeholder** - needs EPUB.js integration
2. **SettingsPage is placeholder** - needs configuration UI
3. **No text selection system** - required for dictionary/AI features
4. **No TOC sidebar** - needed for chapter navigation
5. **No search functionality** - needed for book search

### Performance Considerations

1. **Memory management** for large EPUB files - needs chapter-based loading
2. **Bundle optimization** - needs code splitting for EPUB.js
3. **Caching strategy** - needs intelligent caching for book content
4. **Search indexing** - needs optimization for large books
